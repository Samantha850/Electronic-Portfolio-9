<h2 align="left"><b>ABOUT THE DEVELOPER</b></h2>
<p>
I'm <big><b>Samantha Grace B. Baliao</b></big> and I'm <big><b>the developer</b></big> of this website.<br><br>

As of September 2024, I am 14 years old. I was born in May-Iba, Teresa, Rizal on April 14, 2010. I can proudly say that I<br>
take after my parents, HAHAHHAH; my parents are named Rhiza B. Baliao and Sonny P. Baliao. I have a sibling too, a sister named<br>
Shamirah Faith B. Baliao. She's so playful but so loving at the same time.<br><br>

I currently study in Las Pi√±as City National Science High School (LPCNSHS), also known as LPSci. I'm in ninth grade under<br>
Ma'am Mei's advisory class: 9 - Fairness and is one of the officers in class. I'm also part of the school's official Filipino<br>
publication: Ang Paham and is part of S.Y. 2024-2025 editorial board members as the patnugot ng opinyon.<br><br>

I honestly still struggle in my studies but at least, as time passes by, I learn to control and overcome the hardships<br>
that I face. Studying is not easy but you can enjoy it. Embrace every moment and do not rush the flow because when the<br>
time is right, when God lets you so, you'll eventually get unto where you want to go.<br><br>

<i>Manalig at manampalataya. Fighting!</i><br><br><br>
