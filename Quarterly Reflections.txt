<h2>QUARTERLY REFLECTIONS</h2><br><br>
<h3>FIRST QUARTER</h3>
<p>
It's September 29, 2024 as I am writing this reflection. First quarter has ended and it's exactly two months since the school started.<br>
I've met new classmates and friends, new adviser, new teachers, and there's also lots of new topics to learn. Then there comes the TLE-ICT<br>
class led by Ms. Mary Grace Uminga, also known as Ms. U.<br><br>

I'll be honest, this class is a bit of nerve-wracking but is also so enjoyable at the same time. It's nerve-wracking the way that we do<br>
hands-on activities in ICT room with time pressure and yes, I'll admit too that most of the time, I couldn't finish my work; it's an<br>
unfortunate situation but of course, I can't get stuck at that situation so whenever that happens, I tell myself: "bawi nalang next time".<br>
Coding must be a bit of hard for me since I really do not use computer but as time passes by, I learned to enjoy it. It took time for me to<br>
get used to coding but eventually, through practice and activities, I was able to handle the situation. Up until now, it is still a bit of<br>
challenge for me but at least, I enjoy it; it's the least that I can do so I'll just enjoy the moment and go with flow.<br><br>

With the topics that Ms. U taught us and with the entertaining class I'm included in, I was able to understand and apply my gained knowledge<br>
in our activities. Well, I can also say that I'm now a bit of interested in coding, programming, and such. This unfamiliarity of mine in coding<br>
brought me to a growth that I've never even thought of before. Through this class, I want to grow more, both academically and in personality.<br>
May the environment that I was included in that brought me to self and skill growth, also give hope and strength to others to have a healthy<br>
growth unto themselves. <i>Fighting!</i><br><br><br><br><br>

<h3><big>"</big>Most people takes unfamiliarity as a negative view in life, however, it should not always be like that.<br>
Unfamiliarity doesn't always mean failure nor danger because it may also mean as growth and success.<br>
Being in an unfamiliar situation may seem scary but it can also be a way for us to overcome hurdles<br>
and go out in our comfort zones to combat the fear of risk.<big>"</big></h2><br><br><br>

<h3>SECOND QUARTER</h3>
<p>
It's currently the last day of November as I am writing this reflection. Second quarter is nearing to its end and it's been four months<br>
of journey together with Fairness and grade nine teachers. Our class had already faced many class tasks together, problems continues to arise<br>
but we were able to overcome it each and everytime.<br><br>

Honestly, I feel that my coding during our hands-on activities got worse; it  worsen in a way that up until now, I can't finish my work<br>
and that I can't seem to organize and complete the tasks that I need to accomplish according to the activity's instruction. It sure is<br>
an unfortunate situation because other than the fact that I haven't improve my coding skills, it got more worse. However, I can say that<br>
I still enjoy coding as much as I do last quarter and will keep facing and  overcoming the hurdles that would be given to me; I won't give up.<br><br>

With the lessons shared by Ms. U to us, I would say that I was able to understand more the world of coding though I wasn't able to<br>
seriously apply my knowledge during our hands-on because I seriously failed miserably. However, I'm sure that I did learn knowedges that<br>
I can freely apply in my electronic portfolio this second quarter. Though the presence of unfamiliarity in coding is still present, it<br>
once again brought growth unto  me. Through this class, I hope to grow more, both in my academics and in personality. Once again, may the<br>
environment that I'm part of, give hope, strength, and growth unto other people as well. <i>Fighting!</i><br><br><br><br><br>

you wil never cease to grow.<big>"</big>

<h3><big>"</big>Learning is never supposed to be easy, however, choosing to learn despite facing many difficulties is a good thing.<br>
Learning can be fun and interesting, we just need to be open to creativity and have willingness and passion to learn.<br>
After all, willingness and passion gives a person a reason to be motivated and put time and effort to master unto what<br>
they are passionate to do.<big>"</big><br><br>
